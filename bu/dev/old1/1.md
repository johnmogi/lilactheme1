ðŸ“‹ Developer Request Plan: Custom User Roles, LearnDash Enrollment, and Course Access Control
1. Create Custom User Roles
We need three specific WordPress user roles created:


Role Name	Capabilities	Notes
Teacher	Limited admin access to view student progress and manage assigned courses	No access to plugins, themes, site-wide settings
Student	Front-end only access	Automatically enrolled into free Student Course
Client	Front-end only access	Automatically enrolled into paid Client Course (subscription-based)
Use lightweight PHP or a plugin like Members to create roles.

Ensure each role has appropriate capability restrictions.

2. Auto-Enroll Users Into Courses Based on Their Role
When a new user registers:


Role	Enroll Into
Student	LearnDash Course A (Free, "Closed" access)
Client	LearnDash Course B (Paid, "Closed" access)
Enrollment Details:

Trigger auto-enrollment immediately after user registration (use user_register hook).

Enroll users either into:

Specific courses via ld_update_course_access()

OR into a LearnDash Group if multiple courses are bundled.

3. Restrict Course Access to Logged-In Users Only
All student and client courses must be set to "Closed" access mode in LearnDash.

Visitors (non-logged-in users) should NOT be able to view any course pages.

If a non-logged-in user tries to access a course page, they should be redirected to the Login page.

Example method:

Add a redirect on course pages if !is_user_logged_in().

php
Copy
Edit
add_action('template_redirect', function() {
    if (is_singular('sfwd-courses') && !is_user_logged_in()) {
        wp_redirect(wp_login_url());
        exit;
    }
});
4. Subscription Logic for Clients
Clients purchase monthly or yearly access via WooCommerce Subscriptions (or another membership tool if decided).

After successful purchase, they are enrolled into the Client Course.

If the subscription is canceled, access should be revoked automatically (handled by WooCommerce + LearnDash integration).

5. Deliverables
Custom roles added and documented.

Auto-enrollment working correctly after registration.

Redirection for non-logged-in users set up properly.

Clear test instructions: Register as each role â†’ verify access control and course enrollment.
