# Failed Attempt: Custom LearnDash Hint Implementation

**Date**: 2025-05-05

## Implementation Attempt
1. Created hint metabox in `/includes/quiz/hint-metabox.php`
2. Added admin CSS in `/includes/quiz/admin-hint.css`
3. Integrated with `functions.php`

## Issues Encountered
- Metabox showed but didn't persist hints
- Front-end display didn't sync with backend
- Styling inconsistencies across question types

## Technical Findings
- Meta box rendered but `update_post_meta()` failed silently
- Nonce verification passed but data wasn't saved
- CSS only applied to single-question edit screens

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Missing capability checks during save
2. No error logging for failed meta updates
3. Screen detection too narrow in CSS enqueue

## Proposed Fixes
1. Add debug logging to save function
2. Expand screen detection logic
3. Implement ACF field fallback

## Next Steps
- Rebuild using ACF fields instead
- Verify WP nonce handling
- Test with multiple question formats
