this section in learndash is visible by an admin
but it is not viewable by the student
ant aperant reason?


ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’re asking:
Why is the LearnDash progress section ("בתהליך", progress bar, breadcrumbs) visible to the admin, but not visible to the student?

Here are the most likely reasons (and what you should check step-by-step):

1. Permissions and Visibility Settings
Some LearnDash elements (like progress bars, breadcrumbs) are conditionally hidden based on the user's role.

If the student doesn't have access to the course properly (enrollment issue), the system may hide the infobar.

✅ Check:

Is the student fully enrolled in the course?

Is the lesson status “In Progress” or “Not Started” for the student?

Is there any custom code (CSS/JS) hiding .ld-lesson-status, .ld-progress, etc.?

2. Theme or Custom CSS Hiding for Students
Some WordPress themes or custom CSS hide elements for specific roles (especially .subscriber users).

✅ Check:

Look in your theme’s CSS or in the browser (Inspect Element):

See if you find CSS rules like:

css
Copy
Edit
.subscriber .ld-lesson-status { display: none; }
Also inspect using DevTools:
Is the HTML not rendered at all, or rendered but hidden (display: none)?

3. Course Access Settings
If the course access mode is Open or Free, but the student didn’t formally “Start” it, they might not have a saved progress.

✅ Check:

In LearnDash > Courses > Settings:

What is the Access Mode (Free, Open, Buy Now, Closed)?

Make sure students clicked "Start Course" if needed.

4. LearnDash Shortcode Issue
The shortcode that generates that section (like [ld_infobar]) sometimes doesn’t render for non-logged-in users or users without course progress.

✅ Check:

If you are manually inserting [ld_infobar], make sure it’s inside the correct template area.

Also check if there are conditions like:

php
Copy
Edit
if ( current_user_can( 'administrator' ) ) {
   echo do_shortcode('[ld_infobar]');
}
(which would only show for admins).

5. Caching / User Role Caching
Sometimes WordPress page caching plugins (like WP Rocket, LiteSpeed Cache) serve the wrong cached version depending on the user.

✅ Check:

Clear the full site cache and browser cache.

Temporarily disable caching and recheck logged in as a student.

🔥 Quick checklist for you:

Step	What to Check	How
1	Enrollment	Is the student enrolled?
2	Inspect Element	Is the HTML there but hidden?
3	CSS Rules	Any .subscriber class hiding it?
4	Course Access Mode	Open/Free vs Buy Now?
5	Caching	Clear cache for all roles.
If you want, I can help you write a small script that forces .ld-lesson-status and .ld-progress to show for students too, if you confirm what exactly you want.

Would you like me to create that quick fix too? 🚀 (It's just a small JS or PHP snippet.)






You said:
hmm i thought that by granting access to the course + group it will be enough
is there another section that needs to be connected


ChatGPT said:
You're very close — granting course access + adding to a group is almost enough, but in LearnDash there is one more critical piece many people miss:

📋 In LearnDash, there are three layers of access:

Layer	What it controls	Your case now?
Course Access	Can user access the course?	✅ (You did it)
Group Membership	Is user part of an assigned group?	✅ (You did it)
Lesson/Topic Progression	Has the student "Started" the course properly? (important!)	❓ (Maybe missing!)
🔥 The missing thing is: Course Progress (Enrollment status inside the course)
Even if a student has access, LearnDash waits for the user to actually Start Course to begin tracking progress, unlock infobars, and show progress bars.

If the user never clicked Start Course, LearnDash acts like:

No progress exists.

No infobar.

No progress bars.

➡️ Solution:
You need to make sure that the student starts the course officially.

🚀 How to Fix It:
Log in as the student.

Go to the course page (not a lesson).

Look for a button called "Start Course" or "התחל קורס".

Click it.

After that, LearnDash will:

Create a progress record.

Show the breadcrumb.

Show the progress bar.

Display the infobar (like “100% הושלמו”).

🛠️ If you want it automatic (no need for students to click manually):
You can programmatically mark the course as started via a PHP snippet:

php
Copy
Edit
add_action('template_redirect', function() {
    if (is_singular('sfwd-courses') && is_user_logged_in()) {
        $user_id = get_current_user_id();
        $course_id = get_the_ID();

        if (!learndash_course_status($course_id, $user_id)) {
            ld_update_course_access($user_id, $course_id, $remove = false);
        }
    }
});
✅ This auto-enrolls the user in the course on page load, if they have access but haven't officially started.

🧠 Summary:
Grant access ✅

Add to group ✅

Make sure they "start" the course manually or automatically ⬅️ This was missing.
