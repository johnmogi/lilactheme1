
First, here's what must happen for users to see a "Closed" course:
âœ… 1. The course must be set to Closed (you already did that).
âœ… 2. The user must be manually enrolled into that course (or into a LearnDash group connected to that course).
âœ… 3. Only enrolled users can see the course and lessons.

Here's where you might be stuck:
Custom login (good âœ…) doesn't by itself enroll the user.

Registration (creating a user) does not automatically enroll unless you add custom code or an automation (which you want to do).

Users need to be enrolled into the course after registration.

In other words:
ðŸ‘‰ Logged-in + Enrolled = Access.
ðŸ‘‰ Logged-in but NOT Enrolled = Blocked, even if logged in.

Let's solve it cleanly:
You need to automatically enroll users during registration.

Here's a simple working code snippet to paste into your themeâ€™s functions.php file (or your own mini-plugin):

php
Copy
Edit
add_action('user_register', function($user_id) {
    $user = get_userdata($user_id);
    $roles = (array) $user->roles;

    // Replace these with your actual Course IDs
    $student_course_ids = array(123); // ID of the free Student Course
    $client_course_ids = array(456); // ID of the paid Client Course

    // Auto enroll based on role
    if (in_array('student', $roles)) {
        foreach ($student_course_ids as $course_id) {
            ld_update_course_access($user_id, $course_id);
        }
    }

    if (in_array('client', $roles)) {
        foreach ($client_course_ids as $course_id) {
            ld_update_course_access($user_id, $course_id);
        }
    }
});
How this works:
When someone registers,

It checks if they are a Student or Client (based on role),

Then auto-enrolls them into the correct course(s).

ðŸš€ After this, they will be able to access the "Closed" course right after login.

Double-check checklist:

Check	What to verify
âœ…	User role is properly assigned at registration
âœ…	ld_update_course_access() fires correctly after registration
âœ…	Correct Course ID is used
âœ…	Course is set to "Closed" mode
âœ…	User can see the course under "My Courses" after login
