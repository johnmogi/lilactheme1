auto-enroll every new registrant into LearnDash courses 898 and 1292.

where and how did you do it?

we will need a system in place so this in the future isnt hardcoded

probably a higer admin page that has this among other capacities

- Test by registering a new user and verifying enrollment under LearnDash > Users. Let me know how it goes!


not sure i follow what is happening in real time
i guess well need to go slow over it step by step


Registration & Role
ccr_process_registration() logged
CopyInsert
Registering new user with role → role=school_student  
But when lilac_direct_db_sync_pmpro(24) ran, it saw
CopyInsert
roles => []  
count => 0  
→ No wp_usermeta for wp_capabilities, so the role never persisted.
PMPro Sync
Aborted because no roles → no membership record was created.
LearnDash Auto-Enroll
I don’t see any Auto-enroll hook triggered entries in your lilac-debug.log, so ld_update_course_access() never fired.
Database
No rows in wp_usermeta for user 24’s capabilities.
No entries in wp_learndash_user_activity for user 24.
Next steps:

Search lilac-debug.log for “Auto-enroll hook triggered” to confirm whether your user_register hook fired.
Fix role persistence by, for example, calling clean_user_cache($user_id) right after $user->set_role($role) (or even setting the LD access directly in ccr_process_registration()).
Re-run the flow and then check:
sql
CopyInsert
SELECT * 
  FROM wp_usermeta 
 WHERE user_id=24 
   AND meta_key LIKE '%capabilities%';

SELECT * 
  FROM wp_learndash_user_activity 
 WHERE user_id=24;
Let me know what you find in the logs, and whether you’d like me to adjust the code now (e.g. force-clear cache or call LD enrollment inside the registration routine).
