no
i registered a new student using the form on 
https://lilac.local/testlogin/
that is either using this function at functions.php line 297
or this one on line 241 from 
C:\Users\anist\Desktop\CLIENTS\AVIV\LILAC\app\public\wp-content\themes\hello-theme-child-master\includes\integrations\class-ultimate-member-integration.php

either the case after being granted access to complete the registration
i believe the following function is being called into place
ccr_show_registration_form
at functions.php line 547

once completed i go over to this page
https://lilac.local/courses/%d7%97%d7%99%d7%a0%d7%95%d7%9a-%d7%aa%d7%a2%d7%91%d7%95%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99/

(898)

where there is a student course which is closed and has no users attached to it

also lilac-debug is empty currently
