. Current Admin Structure
Your theme uses a modular admin system under includes/admin/.
Admin pages are registered in PHP classes (e.g., CCR_Registration_Codes in class-registration-codes.php) using add_menu_page and add_submenu_page.
Views are kept in includes/admin/views/.
Scripts and styles are loaded only for relevant admin pages.
2. How to Add a New Admin Page for Quiz Extensions
A. Create a New Admin Class
File:
includes/admin/class-quiz-extensions.php
This class will:
Register a new menu/submenu (e.g., “Quiz Extensions”)
Render the settings page (list quizzes, toggles for “Show Hint”, etc.)
Save settings in the options table (or post meta, as needed)
Load a view file for the UI (e.g., views/quiz-extensions.php)
B. Add a View Template
File:
includes/admin/views/quiz-extensions.php
This will contain the HTML for your settings page, following your other admin views’ style (tables, toggles, dropdowns).
C. Register the Class in Your Theme
In your theme’s main admin loader (where other admin classes are loaded), add:
php
CopyInsert
require_once get_stylesheet_directory() . '/includes/admin/class-quiz-extensions.php';
$ccr_quiz_extensions = new CCR_Quiz_Extensions();
D. Menu Registration Example
php
CopyInsert
public function add_admin_menu() {
    add_menu_page(
        __('Quiz Extensions', 'hello-child'),
        __('Quiz Extensions', 'hello-child'),
        'manage_options',
        'quiz-extensions',
        array($this, 'render_admin_page'),
        'dashicons-welcome-learn-more',
        31 // Order after Registration Codes
    );
}
E. Settings Storage
Use the options table for global settings, or post meta for per-quiz settings.
Namespace your options, e.g., quiz_ext_hints_enabled.
F. UI/UX
Use a table or list to display all quizzes.
For each quiz, show toggles for each enhancement (Hint, Timer, Custom Instructions, etc.).
Add a “Save” button with nonce protection.
3. Why This Approach Matches Your Stack
Follows your modular, folder-based admin structure.
Keeps settings and logic decoupled from quiz content.
Easily extensible for future features.
Consistent with your current admin UI/UX.

Scaffold the new class-quiz-extensions.php and views/quiz-extensions.php files for you?
Provide a sample settings form and save logic?
Draft the code for registering the menu and loading the view?
