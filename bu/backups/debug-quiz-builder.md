# Debugging the Quiz Builder CSV Import

## Issue Analysis

We encountered a critical error when trying to import quiz data from a CSV file. The error was thrown on line 621 in `class-quiz-builder.php`, which is where we were calling the `learndash_set_quiz_complete_options` function without the required ProQuiz ID parameter.

## Fix Applied

1. Updated the `ensure_complete_quiz_settings` method to properly check if the LearnDash function exists
2. Added code to retrieve the ProQuiz ID if it wasn't already provided
3. Added proper error handling when the ProQuiz ID is missing
4. Added more detailed logging to help with future debugging

## Testing Instructions

To test if the fix resolved the issue:

1. Navigate to LearnDash LMS > Quizzes
2. Click on the "Import" tab
3. Upload the sample CSV file (`sample-quiz-import.csv`)
4. Select "Create New Quiz" when prompted
5. Check if the import completes without errors

## CSV Format Requirements

Make sure your CSV file includes the following columns:
- quiz_title: The title of the quiz
- quiz_description: A description of the quiz
- question_text: The text of the question
- question_type: The type of question (single, multiple, essay)
- answer_1 through answer_X: The possible answers
- correct_answer: For single choice, the number of the correct answer (1-based). For multiple choice, semicolon-separated numbers.
- question_hint: Optional hint for the question
- points: Points awarded for a correct answer
- category: Category for the question

## Note on Hebrew Support

The code has been updated to properly handle UTF-8 encoding for Hebrew characters. All text fields from the CSV are now processed through the `ensure_utf8` function.
