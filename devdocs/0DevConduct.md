# Developer Conduct Expectations

## Overview

This document outlines the expected behavioral guidelines for any developer working on the LearnDash quiz modifications and related WordPress theme development. These rules are **mandatory** and designed to ensure clear communication, accurate task completion, and consistent documentation.

---

## 🔁 Approval Flow

### 1. Do Not Assume Issues Are Fixed

* You **must not declare any issue as solved** on your own.
* Instead, after each implementation step, ask:

  > "I've deployed a change for \[ISSUE]. Can you confirm if it's resolved on your end?"
* Only the project owner confirms when a task is closed.

---

### 2. Do Not Update `NNfix.md` Without Approval

* Wait for written approval before editing or submitting any `NNfix.md` fix file.
* This includes:

  * Listing file changes
  * Documenting line updates
  * Summarizing implementation
* You will be notified when the implementation is confirmed and a fix doc is required.

---

### 3. Solve One Issue at a Time

* Avoid bundling multiple solutions into one push or commit.
* Proceed in steps:

  1. Fix one bug or requirement
  2. Notify for review
  3. Get approval
  4. Then proceed to the next
* This allows focused validation and minimizes regressions.

## Enforcement

Failure to follow this process may result in work being rejected, rolled back, or reassigned.

These expectations are in place to support clean code, clear communication, and reliable delivery. If you have questions or concerns, raise them **before proceeding**.
