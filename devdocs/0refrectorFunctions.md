✅ New Plan: Backend-Driven Correct Answer Validation
This plan ensures reliability, testability, and long-term maintainability.

📌 Phase 0 – Prerequisite: Refactor functions.php
Before adding backend logic, finalize the 00RefractorFunctions.md cleanup to:

Extract all quiz-related logic into /includes/quiz/

Create a QuizFlowManager class that handles front/backend quiz behavior

Ensure functions.php only bootstraps and loads modules

🧱 Phase 1 – Backend: Serve Correct Answers to Frontend
🔧 Backend Features (PHP)
Hook into template_redirect or quiz load

Retrieve all questions for current quiz with learndash_get_quiz_questions( $quiz_id )

For each question, get the correct answer using post meta or LearnDash API

Format as { question_id: correct_option_id }

🧠 Store as JSON and serve via:
wp_localize_script() or REST API route (preferred if you want future flexibility)

Example payload:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "42": "1",
  "26": "3"
}
🖥️ Phase 2 – Frontend: Consume and Use the Map
On page load, store the correct answers map into a global window.correctAnswers

When a user selects an answer:

Compare selection against the correct value from the map

Show or hide the “Next” button accordingly

Trigger hint flow if incorrect

🔐 Security note:
Don’t worry about exposing answers — the user can already guess with dev tools. This is for controlled behavior, not assessment security.

✅ Final Flow:
Action	Backend	Frontend
Quiz loads	Generate correct answer map	Store as window.correctAnswers
User selects answer	—	Compare against map
Answer incorrect	—	Trigger hint + keep editable
Answer correct	—	Show “Next” button

🗂️ File Organization Proposal
bash
Copy
Edit
/includes/quiz/
├── QuizFlowManager.php
├── CorrectAnswerService.php
└── assets/js/quiz-answer-flow.js
🚀 Benefits
No guessing

No DOM dependency

No hacks or hardcoding

100% testable in browser console
